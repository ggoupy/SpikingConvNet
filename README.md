# SpikingConvNet

Implementation of the paper *STDP-based spiking deep neural networks for object recognition*, for the MNIST classification task.

## Results

The model achieves > 95% accuracy, better performance can (probably) be reached with parameter tuning.

## MNIST Dataset

See https://pypi.org/project/python-mnist/ to download the dataset.
